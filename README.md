Code In Place Projects to Learn Python

In 2022 I started to "self learn" ai. I used several low and no code platforms to build AI applications, I watched youtube videos and did some small coursera courses and udemy courses.

I wanted to learn more and increase my ability to build what ever I wanted so I began to use APIs and other tools

Finally in 2024 I began to take AWS cloud courses and applied for Code in place at Stanford. 

This repository is a collection of projects for that course that I hope to continue to build on. 

The goal for all of this learning is to become extremely proficient with AI for the future of my work

Here is what I was able to build in roughly one week for the code in place final project. There are issues but I do not want to change it as I am (currently) proud of this effort.

<p> Figured out git and the fact that I am using it wrong. Glad I am learning faster how to build effectively. I started a to do list application. I have always found many of the applications to be wrong for the way I want to work so decided I would build one myself now to use. Below are the requirements for that app as I go. Additionally I am going to use Pycharm as the IDE for that project to learn and iterate with different IDEs and I am going to use VS code to start learning JS for web development.</p>

<br/> 
TO-DO LIST REQUIREMENTS
<br> 
<li> To Do list must have the ability to add edit and delete a list of tasks.</li>
<li> To Do List must have the ability to put due dates in the system (time is not required).</li>
<li> To Do List must have the ability to input requirements as Hard and Soft.</li>
<li> Must be able to rank the properties of the work to be done.</li>
