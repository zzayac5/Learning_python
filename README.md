Code In Place Projects to Learn Python

In 2022 I started to self learn ai. I used several low and no code platforms to build AI applications

I wanted to learn more and increase my ability to build what ever I wanted so I began to use APIs and other tools

Finally in 2024 I began to take AWS cloud courses and applied for Code in place at Stanford. 

This repository is a collection of projects for that course that I hope to continue to build on. 

The goal for all of this learning is to become extremely proficient with AI for the future of my work
