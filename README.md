Code In Place Projects to Learn Python

In 2022 I started to "self learn" ai. I used several low and no code platforms to build AI applications, I watched youtube videos and did some small coursera courses and udemy courses.

I wanted to learn more and increase my ability to build what ever I wanted so I began to use APIs and other tools

Finally in 2024 I began to take AWS cloud courses and applied for Code in place at Stanford. 

This repository is a collection of projects for that course that I hope to continue to build on. 

The goal for all of this learning is to become extremely proficient with AI for the future of my work

Here is what I was able to build in roughly one week for the code in place final project. There are issues but I do not want to change it as I am (currently) proud of this effort.
